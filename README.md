## New Learnings

### 1. useEffect Hook

Explored and implemented the useEffect hook to manage side effects in my Food Ordering App. This powerful React hook allowed me to handle asynchronous operations, data fetching, and other tasks that occur during the lifecycle of a component. The useEffect hook played a crucial role in ensuring a smooth and efficient user interface.

### 2. Shimmer UI

Integrated shimmer UI to enhance the visual appeal of the Food Ordering App. Shimmer UI provides a sleek loading animation, giving users a seamless experience while waiting for content to load. This addition not only improved the overall aesthetics of the app but also contributed to a more polished and professional appearance.

### 3. Need for State Variables

Emphasized the importance of state variables in React, particularly in the context of the Food Ordering App. Leveraging state variables allowed me to manage and update the application's state, ensuring that the user interface accurately reflected the underlying data. This dynamic approach improved interactivity and responsiveness, providing users with a more engaging experience.

### 4. Search Feature Implementation

Implemented a search feature in the Food Ordering App, allowing users to easily find their desired food items. This feature involved utilizing state variables to track user input and dynamically updating the displayed results. The search functionality not only improved the user experience but also showcased the practical application of React concepts in real-world scenarios.

### 5. Building a Food Ordering App

Applied the accumulated knowledge to build a food ordering app. Practiced the integration of React concepts, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.
