## New Learnings

### 1. Props Mastery

Explored the power of React props, mastering the art of passing data between components. Leveraged props to enhance component communication and build more dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

### 2. Destructuring On the Fly

Embraced the elegance of destructuring in JavaScript, enhancing code readability and simplifying the extraction of values from arrays and objects.

### 3. Config-Driven UI

Delved into the concept of a config-driven UI, allowing for a more flexible and customizable user interface. Explored the benefits of separating configuration from code for rapid prototyping and easy modifications.

### 4. Optional Chaining
