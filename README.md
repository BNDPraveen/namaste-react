# Namaste React

# Namaste React - Episode 2

Welcome to the second episode of my React learning journey! In this episode, I explore the basics of React and set up a simple project using npm, React, ReactDOM, and the Parcel bundler. This repository serves as a demonstration of the concepts covered in the episode.

## Project Structure

### Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML file of the project, where the React app is mounted.
- **app.js**: The JavaScript file where the React code is written and bundled using Parcel.

### Dependencies
- **React and ReactDOM**: Core libraries for building user interfaces in React.
- **Parcel**: A fast, zero-configuration web application bundler.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BNDPraveen/namaste-react.git


### Why parcel

- Create Dev Build
- Creates Local Server
- HMR = Hot Module Replacement
- File Watching Algorithm - written in c++
- Caching - Faster Build
- Image Optimization
- Minification
- Bundling
- Compress
- Consistent Hashing
- Code Splitting
- Differential Bundling
- Diagnostics
- Error Handling
- HTTPS
- Tree Spaking - remove unused code
- Different dev and prod bundles
